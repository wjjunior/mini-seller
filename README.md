## Architecture

The project follows a **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture pattern, organizing code by business features rather than technical concerns:

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
2. **Feature Isolation**: Features are self-contained with their own logic and UI
3. **Shared Resources**: Common utilities and components are shared across features
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict typing
5. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage with isolated unit tests
